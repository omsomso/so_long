# so_long

## Description :

Simple 2D game accepting custom maps, my first graphical project ever. Assets by [shubibubi](https://shubibubi.itch.io/).

## How to play

Run `make link` in root folder. Once MiniLibX finishes complaining, run `./so_long [map_name.ber]`, ex. `./so_long [maps/map2.ber]`.

PS : 42 school's MiniLibX has different versions depending on the system, I used the mac version so it won't work elsewhere, unless you change the `src/mlx` folder with yor system's version. Plus I use mac key codes for pretty much everything, so it won't work elsewhere even more, unless you swap the `so_long.h` file's `KEY_<smth>` define macros with your system's ones.

## Example

Here's a vid of the "gameplay"
